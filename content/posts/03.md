## 📚 Introduction

When working with a Linux system, it's essential to understand some fundamental commands and concepts to navigate and interact with the system effectively. In this guide, we'll explore common commands and concepts used in the Linux shell.

### Command Structure

In the Linux shell, commands are typically structured as follows:

```bash
command #options arguments
```

Now, let's delve into some key commands and concepts:

## 📁 Directory Listing

- `ls`: Lists the content of the current directory.
- `ls -l`: Provides a long listing of files and directories.
- `ls -a`: Lists all files, including hidden ones.

## 📃 File Information

- `file`: Determines the type of a file.

## 📄 Viewing File Contents

- `less`: Allows you to view the content of a file.

## 📂 Listing Files in Different Directories

- To list files in the home directory and `/usr/bin`, you can use:

  ```sh
  ls ~ /usr/bin
  ```

### 🔒 File Permissions 

File permissions are represented in the following format:

```bash
-rwxr----- 1 jay jay  900 Nov 3 12 10:35 notes.md
```

- The first character represents the file type (`-` for regular file).
- first character: `-` for regular file, `d` for directory, `l` for symbolic link, `c` for character device, `b` for block device, `s` for socket, `p` for named pipe.
- The next three characters represent owner permissions (`r` for read, `w` for write, `x` for execute).
- The following three characters represent group permissions.
- The last three characters represent other (everyone else) permissions.
- The number **`1`** denotes the number of hard links to the file.
- **`jay`** is the username of the file owner, and **`jay`** is the group name of the file owner.
- **`900`** is the size of the file in bytes.
- **`Nov 3 10:35`** is the date and time of the last modification.
- **`notes.md`** is the file name.

## 📋 Sorting Files

You can sort files using various options with the `ls` command:

- `ls -lt`: Sorts by time.
- `ls -ltr`: Sorts by time in reverse order.
- `ls -lS`: Sorts by size.
- `ls -lSr`: Sorts by size in reverse order.
- `ls -lSh`: Sorts by size in a human-readable format.
- `ls -lShr`: Sorts by size in a human-readable format in reverse order.

## 📂 File Types

In a Unix-like system, everything is considered a file. For example, `/dev/sda` represents the hard disk.

## 📜 Viewing File Contents

To view the contents of a file, you can use the `less` command:

```sh
less notes.md
```

- Use "q" to quit from the `less` command.
- Navigate using arrow keys.
- "h" for help, "1G" or "g" to move to the beginning of the file.
- "G" to go to the end of the file.
- "/" to search, "n" for the next search result, "N" for the previous search result.
- "space" to move to the next page, "b" to move to the previous page.
- "h" for help, "q" to quit.
