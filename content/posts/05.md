### wildcards

- wildcards :
  - `*` : match any number of characters.
  - `?` : match any single character.
  - `[ch]`: match any single character within the specified range.
  - `[!ch]` : match any single character not within the specified range.
  - `[[:class:]]` : match any character belonging to the specified class.
        - `[:alnum:]` : match any alphanumeric character.
        - `[:alpha:]` : match any alphabetic character.
        - `[:digit:]` : match any digit.
        - `[:lower:]` : match any lowercase character.
        - `[:upper:]` : match any uppercase character.

- * => display all files in the current directory.
- a* => starts with a.
- j*.txt => starts with j and ends with .txt.
- jay??? => start with jay and have 3 characters.
- bak.[0-9][0-9][0-9] => starts with bak and have 3 digits.
- [[:upper:]]* => starts with uppercase character.
- [![:digit:]]* => starts with non digit character.
- [a-z] => match any single character within the specified range.

### commands for manipulating files and directories

```sh
cp
mv
mkdir 
rm 
ln
```



```sh
mkdir dir #create directory
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3   #create multiple directories
mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3 #create parent directory if not exist
```

```sh
cp #copy file or directory
cp item... directory
cp -a item... directory #copy with attributes
cp -i item... directory #prompt before overwrite
cp -r item... directory #copy recursively
cp -u item... directory #copy if source is newer than destination
cp -v item... directory #explain what is being done
cp file1 file2 dir1 #copy file1 and file2 to dir1
```

```sh
mv #move and rename file or directory
mv -i f1 f2 #prompt before overwrite
mv -u f1 f2 #move if source is newer than destination
mv -v f1 f2 #explain what is being done
```


```sh
rm #remove file and directory
rm main.go #remove file
rm -i main.go #prompt before remove
rm -r dir #remove directory recursively (remove all files and subdirectories)
rm -f dir #force remove directory
rm -v dir #explain what is being done
```

- linux has no recycle bin. when you delete a file it is gone forever. be careful when using rm command.ls the file before removing it.

```sh
ln #create link
ln -s item link 
```

- Symbolic links were created to overcome the limitations of hard links. Symbolic links work by creating a special type of file that contains a text pointer to the referenced file or dir.

```sh
ls -li #list files with inode number
```
- Symbolic links were created to overcome the two disadvantages of hard links: Hard links cannot span physical devices and hard links cannot reference directories, only files. Symbolic links are a special type of file that contains a text pointer to the target file or directory.

- One thing to remember about symbolic links is that most file operations are carried out on the link's target, not the link itself. rm is an exception. When you delete a link, it is the link that is deleted, not the target.

- we can also create symbolic link using the GUI also. right click on the file and select make link.
