## 📚 Overview

- Linux uses a **hierarchical file system**, which is structured like a tree 🌳.
- All files are stored in the root directory (`/`).
- There are no separate drives like `C:`, `D:`, `E:` as in Windows.
- Linux paths can be **absolute** (e.g., `/home/username`) or **relative** (e.g., `./`).
- **absolute path** is the path which starts from the root directory.
- **relative path** is the path which starts from the current directory.
- in linux there is no concept of file extension. 
- Hidden files in Linux start with a `.` and can be viewed using `ls -a`.

## 📝 Key Commands

```sh
pwd             # 📍 Displays the present working directory
```

```sh
cd              # 🚀 Changes the directory
```

```sh
ls              # 📑 Lists directory content
```

```sh
cd ..           # ↩️ Navigates to the parent directory
```

```sh
cd .            # 🔄 Navigates to the current directory
```

```sh
cd              # 🏠 Navigates to the home directory
```

```sh
cd -            # 🔙 Navigates to the previous directory
```

```sh
cd ~user_name   # 👤 Navigates to the home directory of a specific user
```

## ℹ️ Additional Information

- we can use `tree` command to see the tree structure of the directory.
- if we want to see the tree structure of the directory with the hidden files then we can use `tree -a` command.
- if tree command is not installed then we can install it using `sudo apt install tree` command.
